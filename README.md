InnerVerse — Learning Hub

A growing garden of practical, compassionate, and powerful tools for life’s ups and downs.

InnerVerse is a premium, content-first web app designed to feel like luxury self-care: calm visuals, clear structure, and deeply helpful lessons. It ships as a single, production-ready HTML file (vanilla JS + CSS) with a minimalist left-side directory, a narrative Self-Discovery module, and a lightweight membership gate (Stripe checkout link + local unlock codes for dev/demo).

⚠️ Note: The included membership gate uses localStorage for demo purposes. For real payments/access control, you’ll want a server-side verification flow (details below).

✨ Features

Minimalist left directory to navigate modules.

Narrative, app-ready lessons with story-style writing, practices, tools, and check-ins.

“Meaningful typography” cues (e.g., 3D/4D/5D lenses use different fonts).

Smooth chip navigation to jump to key lesson anchors.

Reader comforts: dropcaps, soft gradients, wide margins, and section dividers.

Local bookmarks (❤️ buttons) saved to localStorage.

Lightweight paywall: Stripe payment link + dev unlock codes.

Zero build tooling: Works as a static site on any host (Netlify, Vercel, Pages, S3, etc.).
