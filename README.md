# Experience Points

**Level up through lived experience.**

Experience Points is a quiet, grounded project focused on self-trust, integration, and conscious growth through real life — not performance, optimization, or urgency.

This repository hosts the public-facing website for **Experience Points**, built as a static site (GitHub Pages–friendly) with clarity, accessibility, and longevity in mind.

## What Experience Points Is

Experience Points is not a self-help brand in the traditional sense.

It exists to help people:
- translate lived experience into insight
- rebuild trust with their inner signals
- understand adaptive patterns without self-blame
- make decisions with clarity instead of compulsion
- integrate awareness into daily life, slowly and safely

This project prioritizes:
- nervous-system-aware pacing
- ethical design
- non-coercive language
- user autonomy
- depth without overwhelm

## Core Philosophy

Growth is not self-improvement.

Growth is alignment between:
- what you know
- what you feel
- what you choose
- what you tolerate
- what you repeat

Experience Points exists to support that alignment — without telling people who to be or how fast to change.
