      <h1>The Architecture of Awareness</h1>
      <p class="sub">
        This curriculum isn’t about fixing yourself — it’s about remembering how you work.
        It teaches you to navigate the inner landscape of emotion, thought, and need so that
        you can act from wisdom instead of survival. Simple. Honest. Human.
      </p>

      <h2>Why awareness is the ultimate education</h2>
      <p>
        Most of us were taught to manage our behavior, not our *being*. We learned to be polite, productive,
        and composed — but rarely how to name what’s happening inside us in real time.
        This leaves us navigating life like pilots with fogged windows: reacting instead of responding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Awareness clears the window. When you learn to see your *state* (what’s happening in your body),
        your *story* (the beliefs shaping perception), your *need* (what your system is asking for), and your next *step*,
        you stop getting lost in reaction and start living with direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of it like emotional cartography — learning the map of your inner world so you can travel it with confidence.
      </p>

    <!-- CORE MODEL -->
    <section class="card reveal">
      <div class="pill">The Core Model</div>
      <h2>State → Story → Need → Step</h2>
      <p>
        This is the heart of the Mynd Framework. Four simple words that can transform how you meet yourself.
        Below, we’ll walk through each one like a teacher sitting beside you — not a textbook talking at you.
      </p>

      <div class="grid grid-2">
        <div>
          <h3>1. State — “Name it.”</h3>
          <p>
            Your *state* is what your nervous system is doing right now. It’s not good or bad — it’s a message.
            Fear says, “I don’t feel safe.” Anger says, “Something matters to me.” Sadness says, “I’m losing something.”
          </p>
          <p>
            When you name your state, you stop fighting it.  
            Saying “This feels like fear” tells your body, *we’re aware*. Awareness itself is regulating.
          </p>
          <p class="muted"><em>Example:</em> You’re about to send a message you’ve been avoiding. You notice your heart racing.
          Instead of judging it, you name it: “This feels like fear — fear of rejection.” Instantly, you exhale. You’ve gone
          from being *inside* fear to being *with* it.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>2. Story — “Understand it.”</h3>
          <p>
            Beneath every emotion is a story — a belief or prediction about what reality means.
            Sometimes that story is true; sometimes it’s a memory pretending to be the present.
          </p>
          <p>
            This step is about curiosity, not control.  
            Ask: “What is this protecting?” or “What might I be assuming right now?”
          </p>
          <p class="muted"><em>Example:</em> You notice anger rising when a friend cancels plans.  
          The story beneath it? “I’m not important.”  
          But when you pause, you realize — the story is old. It’s your past interpreting the present. Awareness breaks the loop.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>3. Need — “Meet it.”</h3>
          <p>
            Every emotion points toward a need — safety, connection, dignity, rest, or truth.
            Needs are not weaknesses; they’re instructions from the deeper intelligence of life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you know the need, the next step becomes obvious.
          </p>
          <p class="muted"><em>Example:</em> You feel shame after speaking up. The need beneath shame is usually *belonging* or *repair*.
          So you text your friend: “Hey, I was nervous earlier and I said that poorly. I care about you.” Need met. Nervous system calm.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>4. Step — “Act with integrity.”</h3>
          <p>
            Awareness isn’t just reflection — it’s movement. Once you know your state, story, and need,
            you can take one aligned action, however small. The key word: one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Big transformations begin with micro-movements.
            Healing is less about dramatic leaps and more about steady realignment.
          </p>
          <p class="muted"><em>Example:</em> You realize your need is rest. Your step?  
          Turn your phone on silent for 30 minutes and lie down. Simple acts are spiritual acts when done consciously.</p>

    <!-- EXTENDED TEACHING -->

      <div class="pill">Integration</div>
      <h2>How to use this framework in real life</h2>
      <p>
        You don’t need hours of journaling or perfect self-discipline — just small moments of awareness
        repeated with kindness. Below are three everyday examples of how to apply the Mynd Framework.
      </p>

      <details class="lift" open>
        <summary>💬 Example 1 — Emotional spiral</summary>
        <p><strong>Situation:</strong> You get critical feedback and instantly feel tense and small.</p>
        <p><strong>State:</strong> Shame. <strong>Story:</strong> “I’m failing again.” <strong>Need:</strong> Reassurance + learning. <strong>Step:</strong> Breathe. Then reply, “Thank you for the feedback — I want to understand it.” You’ve stayed connected instead of collapsing.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="lift">
        <summary>❤️ Example 2 — Relationship tension</summary>
        <p><strong>State:</strong> Anger. <strong>Story:</strong> “They don’t care.” <strong>Need:</strong> Respect. <strong>Step:</strong> “I care about this, and I need us to talk when we’re both calm.” The body relaxes because you gave the emotion a voice that honors both people.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="lift">
        <summary>🌿 Example 3 — Burnout cycle</summary>
        <p><strong>State:</strong> Exhaustion. <strong>Story:</strong> “I can’t stop or everything will fall apart.” <strong>Need:</strong> Rest + boundaries. <strong>Step:</strong> Say no kindly. Turn off notifications. Drink water. Rest becomes revolutionary.</p>
      </details>

      <p>
        Think of this process like learning to speak a language you were never taught — the language of your own mind and body.
        With practice, it becomes fluent. You stop overthinking and start understanding.
