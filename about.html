    <section class="detail">
      <p>There comes a point in every life where survival stops being enough.</p>
      <p>Where keeping the peace costs too much.</p>
      <p>Where you realize you’ve been living on autopilot — carrying emotions that aren’t yours, repeating stories that no longer serve you.</p>
      <p>For a long time, I thought healing meant <em>understanding.</em> I read every book, studied every theory, analyzed every feeling — thinking that if I could just name my pain, I could control it.</p>
      <p><strong>But what I eventually learned is that understanding doesn’t heal you. Love does.</strong></p>
      <p>The kind of love that is patient enough to see the patterns, gentle enough to forgive the past, and brave enough to rewrite the story.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="detail">
      <p>Through years of inner work, reflection, and awakening, I began to see how our inner world mirrors the outer one.</p>
      <p>Our nervous system branches like the roots of a tree.<br>
      Neurons resemble the cosmic web of galaxies.<br>
      Rivers flow like veins through Earth’s skin.<br>
      Lungs breathe like leaves in the wind.<br>
      And our blood carries the same elements as the stars.</p>
      <p><strong>Everything is connected. Everything is alive. Everything is conscious.</strong></p>
      <p>Earth, I realized, is not just a home — it’s a school for the soul. A place where we each learn to move from fear toward love, from reaction to creation, from unconscious patterns to conscious choice.</p>
      <p><strong>That realization became the seed of Mynd.</strong></p>
      <p>I began to see that every experience, every belief, every emotion — begins and ends in the mind.</p>
      <p>We, as humans, are the greatest storytellers. We build worlds out of words. We tell ourselves stories to survive, to belong, to make sense of what we can’t yet understand.</p>
      <p>For most of our lives, those stories tell us who we are. But once we realize that we are the storytellers — not the story — our entire reality opens up.</p>
      <p>That’s when life transforms from reaction to creation. From unconscious repetition to conscious authorship. From being shaped by the mind to shaping it.</p>
      <p><strong>This is what Mynd stands for — the moment you remember that you are not the narrative you inherited… you are the author of what comes next.</strong></p>
    </section>

    <section class="detail">
      <h2 style="margin-top:0">🌱 Why “Mynd”</h2>
      <p>The name <strong>Mynd</strong> comes from <em>My Mind.</em></p>
      <p>Because everything begins and ends there.</p>
      <p>Your mind is the lens through which you experience the world — <strong>the soil where your beliefs take root, the garden where your emotions grow, and the sky where awareness expands.</strong></p>
      <p>No one else’s perception can determine your peace. No one else’s beliefs can limit your becoming.</p>
      <p><strong>You hold the power to change everything — with just your mind.</strong></p>
    </section>

    <section class="detail">
      <h2 style="margin-top:0">🌾 What Mynd Is</h2>
      <p><strong>Mynd was born from the space between therapy and transcendence — the bridge between psychology and soul.</strong></p>
      <p>It’s built for the ones who grew up feeling “too much,” the ones who carry invisible stories, the ones who sense there’s more to this life than survival.</p>
      <p>It’s not just an app; it’s a mirror — a tool to reconnect you to your own inner intelligence.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="detail">
      <h2 style="margin-top:0">🌸 What Mynd Stands For</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Self-awareness as freedom.</strong> You can’t choose what you’re not conscious of.</li>
        <li><strong>Accountability as empowerment.</strong> You are not your past, but you are the author of what comes next.</li>
        <li><strong>Love as intelligence.</strong> True growth doesn’t come from judgment; it comes from gentleness.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="detail">
      <h2 style="margin-top:0">🌺 The Invitation</h2>
      <p>Mynd invites you to explore the garden of your inner world — one conscious thought, one feeling, one moment at a time.</p>
      <p>It’s where awareness meets design, where journaling meets neuroscience, and where you remember that your life is not something happening to you — it’s something <em>unfolding through</em> you.</p>
      <p>Today, I no longer chase peace. <strong>I cultivate it.</strong></p>
      <p>And Mynd is my way of helping you do the same.</p>
      <p><strong>You are not too much. You are the beginning of your own becoming.</strong></p>
