      <h1>The Narrator Within</h1>
      <p class="sub">
        Every human has an inner storyteller — part historian, part bodyguard.  
        It wants to keep you safe, but sometimes it forgets you’ve grown.
      </p>
    </div>

    <section class="card reveal">
      <h2>Our thoughts are ancient protectors</h2>
      <p>
        The mind’s first job isn’t to make you happy — it’s to make you *safe*.  
        Every belief, assumption, and judgment is an attempt to predict pain before it happens.
      </p>
      <p>
        But protection can become imprisonment. Old stories — “I’m too much,” “I’m never chosen,” “I’ll fail again” — 
        start to steer your perception long after they’ve expired.
      </p>

      <h3>Think of your stories like wallpaper</h3>
      <p>
        You stop noticing it after a while. It becomes “just how life looks.”
        But awareness lets you step back and realize — *this pattern was chosen by an old version of me.*
        You can peel it off gently.
      </p>

      <div class="hr"></div>

      <h3>Try this reflection</h3>
      <p><strong>1.</strong> Think of a recent emotional reaction.<br>
      <strong>2.</strong> Ask: “What was I believing in that moment?”<br>
      <strong>3.</strong> Ask: “Is this belief still true now?”</p>

      <p class="muted">
        That’s awareness. You just separated the *observer* from the *narrator* — and that’s how freedom begins.
      </p>
