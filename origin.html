            <h1>Why Experience Points exists</h1>
            <p class="subhead">
              Experience Points exists because many people are trying to live honest lives inside systems that taught them to distrust themselves.
              Not because they’re weak. Not because they lack insight. But because they learned — often very early — that clarity, emotion, and truth were inconvenient.

              Experience Points is built on one foundational belief:
              <strong>Growth happens when lived experience is integrated — not bypassed, not erased, not reframed prematurely.</strong>

            <p>
              Integration is what turns experience into wisdom. Without it, insight stays trapped in the body as tension, doubt, or fatigue.
